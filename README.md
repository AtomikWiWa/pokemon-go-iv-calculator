# pokemon-go-iv-calculator
This is a Pokemon GO IV Calculator built into a MS Excel spreadsheet

The advantage of this tool over the many other IV calculators that exist is that the MS Excel interface makes it relatively easy to:

* enter data in batches (collect Pokemon & CP data on box screen, before HP & Stardust data on individual Pokemon pages)
* store results without needing to rename your Pokemon in-game
* easily track and analyze your Pokemon in a spreadsheet environment (compare IVs, count evolutions, etc.)
